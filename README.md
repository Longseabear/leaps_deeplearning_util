# Deep learning util Functions
I am doing a large CNN project. 
But it seems that there is not much utility function for data preprocessing than thought.
So I will release the utility function I created.

This code is basically for my research purposes.
So please modify my code and use it.
No copyright.:)
I will continue to add.

# Function
- Data Preprocessing
    * Layered_sampling.py
    ```
    Sampling data hierarchically.
    Modify Image file to Tfrecord according to label distribution.
